        <p>Savage Beauty was an art exhibition held in
      2011 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art featuring
      clothing created by British fashion designer Alexander
      McQueen, as well as accessories created for his runway
      shows. The exhibit was extremely popular in New York
      City and resulted in what was then record attendance
      for the museum. The curators were Andrew Bolton
      and Harold Koda.</p>

      <p>The exhibit was organized by the museum's Anna Wintour Costume Center
         and curated by Andrew Bolton and Harold Koda. The exhibit featured
         McQueen's pieces from the archives of his own London fashion house,
         Alexander McQueen, and of the Parisian couture house Givenchy, as
         well as pieces held in private collections. The show is composed
         of six separate galleries, arranged by theme: "The Romantic Mind",
         featuring some of his oldest work in the early 1990s; "Romantic
         Gothic and the Cabinet of Curiosities", featuring his exploration
         of Victorian Gothic themes; "Romantic Nationalism", examining
         Scottish and British identity; "Romantic Exoticism", examining
         non-western influences in his designs; "Romantic Primitivism",
         featuring natural materials and organic designs; and "Romantic
         Naturalism", featuring his attempts to integrate themes of the natural
         world with technology.</p>

            Jack the Ripper Stalks His Victims, created during his graduate
            studies at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design. Other

            and Plato's Atlantis, as well as Banshee, Highland Rape, The Widows
